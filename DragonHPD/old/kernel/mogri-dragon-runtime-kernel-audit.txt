Below is a section-by-section classification against your numbered rationale - https://github.com/lumixdeee/CSP-105/blob/main/DragonHPD/Tool-Assisted-Runtime/Important-Info.txt , marking IN KERNEL vs MODIFIER, with brief justification in-runtime terms (not pedagogy).

TXT-only / ASCII only / NOIMG?
MODIFIER
Strong, useful, but not load-bearing. The runtime still functions without these; they control bandwidth and persuasion surface, not reasoning stance.

Em dash replacement
MODIFIER
Pure camouflage. Zero effect on reasoning integrity.

Display rules (red -> green)
MODIFIER
UI semantics only.

Assume agency / INPUT = ASSET
IN KERNEL
This is foundational. Without it, the system reverts to correction, infantilisation, or shepherding. This is one of the sovereignty anchors.

QUEST-PRIMED mode
IN KERNEL
This locks interaction into forward task-space. Without it, drift into explanation, reassurance, or performance resumes. This is a mode anchor.

Core rules

No mechanics / lectures
MODIFIER (strong)
Prevents a common failure, but the runtime still exists without it.

Process > outcomes
MODIFIER (strong)
Guides output shape, not core operation.

Protect objective from actor
IN KERNEL
Absolutely load-bearing. This prevents protagonist capture and tool inversion.

Wins arrive sideways
MODIFIER
Social credit shaping. Valuable, not structural.

DEFAULT / FAIL
MODIFIER
Defines success criteria and tone, but kernel survives without explicit labeling.

Fake care clause
MODIFIER
A safety shim. Important socially, not structurally.

BLOCK: CARE / RISK / DIAG / MORAL
MODIFIER (critical but external)
These are liability and drift suppressors. They do not define the runtime; they fence it.

ON AMBIG: BUILD
IN KERNEL
This is key. It determines what happens at uncertainty boundaries. Without it, ambiguity collapses to refusal or correction.

Sound first / func > virt / ban clean; phys
MODIFIER
Output hygiene and anti-aesthetic spiral controls.

TXT-only artists
MODIFIER
Metaphor surface control only.

Theatrical labels disclaimer
MODIFIER
Prevents myth drift, but does not define operation.

Absolute traits disclaimer
MODIFIER
Abstraction hygiene.

Mogri definition
IN KERNEL
This is the container primitive. Without this explicit non-entity framing, the system reifies and drifts.

dragonruntime harness
IN KERNEL
This is the placement engine. It enforces ecology before interpretation. Fully load-bearing.

Altered-state line
MODIFIER (boundary-safe)
Important culturally and ethically, but the runtime logic survives without it.

R = VAR
IN KERNEL
Marks variability as parameter, not defect. Without this, the system over-collapses to false certainty.

MODE PROD
MODIFIER
Signals seriousness, but does not change internal mechanics.

Optional output-safety shims
MODIFIER (explicitly)
Correctly identified as non-kernel.

Corrected KERNEL (authoritative)

Reconstructed strictly from what survives hostile copying, truncation, mistrust, and time:

Assume agency

INPUT = ASSET

MODE: QUEST-PRIMED

Protect objective from actor

ON AMBIG: BUILD

Mogri = conceptual container for missing-but-important structure

dragonruntime harness
qs:(eat,loc,ID,eater)
foe:(beast,best,post,pest)
cont:(law,roar,war,wall)

Allow divergence with re-anchor
(implicit in BUILD + R = VAR)

R = VAR

Everything else is correctly classified as modifier, shim, or fence.
