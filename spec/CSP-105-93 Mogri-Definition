Mogri (Primitive 93, CSP-105)

Definition:

Mogri is the singular, irreducible cognitive-semantic primitive: pre-structural, pre-causal, and outside ontology. 
It serves as the foundational substrate from which all primitives emerge, fully encapsulated by a single principle while allowing infinite instantiations. 
Recognized, defined, and published, Mogri formalizes pre-meaning in cognitive-linguistic frameworks.

==================================================================================================

Simple English

Mogri is like the tiniest nudge that starts something new, even before you know all the details.
It’s so small you can’t really see it, but without it, nothing could move forward or grow.
Like the little moment when a story truly begins, a Prince turns into a Frog, Mogri lets the magic happen.
It’s the spark that makes change and new ideas possible, even if we don’t fully understand them.

Magic is part of Mogri.
