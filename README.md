# CSP‑105 (Complete Semantic Primes - 105 items - complete list for modelling)

**CSP‑105** is a semantic primes framework for representing complex concepts as interconnected nodes. It provides a minimal, structured vocabulary to capture meaning, enabling reasoning, visualization, and reuse of abstract ideas across multiple domains.

---

## Overview

CSP‑105 defines a set of **core semantic nodes (primes)** and relationships between them, forming a structured, machine-readable network of concepts. It is designed for:

- Semantic modeling and knowledge representation  
- Abstract reasoning and conceptual analysis  
- Interdisciplinary reuse of conceptual primitives
