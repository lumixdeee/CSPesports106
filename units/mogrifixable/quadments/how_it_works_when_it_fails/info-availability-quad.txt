The following chatGPT excerpt shows that the creation of 'quadments' is not  
a case of 'shooting fish in a barrel'.


info availability quad:   

axes - visible/occulted - available/missing  
  
make such a quad pls, fill in the four words to represent each type of info  
private, public, .... , ...... fill in the gaps  


 ______________________________________________
| how?\which?  | available       | unavailable |
|______________|_________________|_____________|
| visible       | public         | private     |
|______________|_________________|_____________|
| occulted      | hidden         | unknown     |
|______________|_________________|_____________|


  So:

Visible + available → public

Visible + unavailable → private

Occulted + available → hidden

Occulted + unavailable → unknown  


so in other words, no pun intended,  
there is no missing forth that needs to be filled by mogri here?   


Exactly—no hidden Mogri twist needed here. 😏

The four quadrants are complete as-is: public, private, hidden, unknown.  
Mogri doesn’t sneak in to fill a fifth;  
the “info space” is already fully mapped by the axes you set.

If anything, you could say Mogri just… hovers over the whole quad,  
subtly blurring the lines between hidden and unknown.  
But that’s flavor, not a missing label.
